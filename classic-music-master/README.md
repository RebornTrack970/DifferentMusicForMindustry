# Mindustry Classic Music Pack
Self explanatory, it plays Mindustry Classic music. Versions used from old Mindustry version and downloadable version of Mindustry Classic. Make sure to extract the `.zip` file, otherwise it would crash the game (especially on mobile version).
Credits to Anuke (Mindustry dev) and the music creator, I didn't make any of those (except the mod duh).
